# Model-Optimization-guided Neural Networks
In this repository, we provide the algorithms developed in the strategy "Model Optimization-guided Neural Networks" [MOGNN]. The strategy is based on two steps: [i] optimization of a physical model, using the algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization [PSO] and [ii] neural network training with optimized data.
In this work, the goal is to apply approximate models for the optimization of chemical processes. In the proposed strategy, steady-state optimization is performed in a pre-training step, as shown in figure below. The steps can be divided into [1] data collection: process simulation-optimization, [2] ANN training, [3] model validation and [4] application of the ANN model.
