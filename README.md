# Model-Optimization-guided Neural Networks
In this repository, we provide the algorithms developed in the strategy "Model Optimization-guided Neural Networks" [MOGNN]. The strategy is based on two steps: [i] optimization of a physical model, using the algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization [PSO] and [ii] neural network training with optimized data.
